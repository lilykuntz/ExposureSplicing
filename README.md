# ExposureSplicing
A python program that when given as input two photos of the same scene, but at different exposures, will use the exposure of the foreground of one picture and the background exposure of another to create one image with the best exposure. 
Running this python code will promt a Tkinter window to pop up. From this window you can upload two images of the same scene.
Adjusting the Tkinter slider widget labeled "threshold" and selecting the desired checkboxes before hitting the "Fix" button
will display the final image in the center of the screen. The resulting image should display a desired image that has the best exposure. The
user can continue to adjust the values until the image appears as desired.
